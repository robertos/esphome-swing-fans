This is an ESPHome custom component to control multiple [Swing Fans DC ceiling fans](https://swingfans.com/collections/dc-ceiling-fan) that use [remotes that look like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMw-yNIsO1c). The protocol uses a 12-bit or 24-bit command code, with specific pulse timings for sync, 0, and 1 bits.

> **NOTE:** This is shared with no guarantees that this will work or that it won't damage your fans. Use it at your own risk. This project has no relationship with the Swing Fans manufacturer.

This component requires you to configure separate [`remote_transmitter`](https://esphome.io/components/remote_transmitter.html) and [`remote_receiver`](https://esphome.io/components/remote_receiver.html) components, allowing flexibility in your choice of RF hardware (e.g., simple GPIO pins, CC1101 modules via their own transmitter/receiver platforms, etc.).

**Features:**

* Control multiple fans from a single ESP device.
* Supports the specific 5-bit ID + 7/19-bit command protocol.
* Integrates with standard ESPHome `remote_transmitter` and `remote_receiver`.
* Provides standard `fan` entities for Home Assistant (supporting On/Off and 6 speeds).
* Provides optional `button` entities to send the 'flip' (direction change) command.
* Allows hooks (`on_transmit_begin`/`on_transmit_end`) for transmitters requiring special handling (like CC1101 mode switching).
* Updates fan state in Home Assistant if commands are received via RF (e.g., from the original remote).

## Dependencies

* ESPHome - tested on 2025.3.3.
* [`remote_transmitter`](https://esphome.io/components/remote_transmitter.html) component configured in your YAML.
* [`remote_receiver`](https://esphome.io/components/remote_receiver.html) component configured in your YAML (specifically listening for `rc_switch` data).
* `fan` and `button` components defined in your YAML so `swing_fans` can add more fans and buttons. 

## Hardware

- ESP32 board
- Some RF transmitter - I used a CC1101 module

For an example of building the hardware, see the [instructions in the ESPSomfy-RTS wiki](https://github.com/rstrouse/ESPSomfy-RTS/wiki/Simple-ESPSomfy-RTS-device).

## Installation

You can install this component using the `external_components` feature of ESPHome. Add the following to your device's YAML configuration:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://robertos/esphome-swing-fans@main # Or specify a release tag
    components: [ swing_fans ] # Specify the component name
```

## Configuration

```yaml
# 1. Configure your chosen transmitter and receiver FIRST
remote_transmitter:
  id: gpio_tx # Example ID
  pin: GPIO32 # Example pin
  carrier_duty_percent: 100%

# The receiver is only required if you want to listen for other remotes
remote_receiver:
  id: gpio_rx # Example ID
  pin: GPIO33 # Example pin
  tolerance: 60%
  filter: 4us
  idle: 4ms
  dump: rc_switch # Recommended for debugging
  on_rc_switch:
    then:
      - swing_fans.received_code:
          hub_id: fan_controller
          code: !lambda return x.code;
          protocol: !lambda return x.protocol;

# 2. Configure the main swing_fans controller
swing_fans:
  id: fan_controller # An ID for this controller instance
  remote_transmitter_id: gpio_tx # Link to your transmitter ID

  # Optional hooks for complex transmitters (see CC1101 example below)
  # on_transmit_begin:
  #   - ...
  # on_transmit_end:
  #   - ...

  # List ALL fans controlled by this component
  fans:
    - name: "Office Fan" # Must be unique and match fan/button entities below
      fan_id: "01000"    # The 5-bit binary ID for this fan
      is_24_bit: false   # Optional, set to true if this fan uses the longer command format
    - name: "Living Room Fan"
      fan_id: "00100"
      is_24_bit: false
    - name: "Second Room Fan"
      fan_id: "11101"
      is_24_bit: true
    # ... add all other fans here

# 3. Create empty fan and button lists to be filled by swing_fans
fan: []
button: []
```

### Configuration Variables

**`swing_fans` (Hub):**

* **id** (Optional, ID): Manually specify the ID used for linking.
* **remote_transmitter_id** (Required, ID): The ID of the `remote_transmitter` component to use for sending commands.
* **fans** (Required, list): A list defining each fan.
    * **name** (Required, string): The unique name for this fan. This name is used to link the `fan.swing_fans` and `button.swing_fans_direction` entities back to this configuration.
    * **fan_id** (Required, string): The 5-character binary string representing the fan's unique ID (e.g., `"01000"`).
    * **is_24_bit** (Optional, boolean): Set to `true` if this specific fan uses the longer 19-bit command format (total 24 bits including ID). Defaults to `false` (7-bit command format, total 12 bits).
    * **direction_button_icon** (Optional, Icon): The icon to be used for the direction button entity, defaults to `"mdi:swap-horizontal`.
    * **direction_button_name** (Optional, string): The name of the entity for the direction button, defaults to `<Fan Name> Direction`.
    * **restore_mode** (Optional): Control how the fan attempts to restore state on boot. See the [ESPHome docs for Fan](https://esphome.io/components/fan/index.html), defaults to `ALWAYS_OFF`.
* **on_transmit_begin** (Optional, Action): An action to perform immediately before transmitting a command. Useful for `cc1101.begin_tx`.
* **on_transmit_end** (Optional, Action): An action to perform immediately after transmitting a command. Useful for `cc1101.end_tx`.

## Example with CC1101

If you are using a CC1101 module via an external component that provides `remote_transmitter` and `remote_receiver` interfaces (check your specific CC1101 component's documentation):

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://robertos/esphome-swing-fans@main
    components: [ swing_fans ]
  # Using this component until esphome/esphome/pull/6300 is merged
  - source: github://gabest11/esphome@7c6ee9c658d9ea7efd9d75d19a0d037d98581837
    components: [ cc1101 ]

spi:
  clk_pin: GPIO18
  miso_pin: GPIO19
  mosi_pin: GPIO23

cc1101:
  id: transceiver
  cs_pin: GPIO5
  frequency: 433920
  bandwidth: 200

remote_transmitter:
  - id: transmitter
    pin: GPIO32 # GDO0 on the CC1101
    carrier_duty_percent: 100%

remote_receiver:
  - id: receiver
    pin: GPIO33 # GDO2 on the CC1101
    tolerance: 60%
    filter: 4us
    idle: 4ms
    dump:
      - rc_switch
    on_rc_switch:
      then:
        - swing_fans.received_code:
            hub_id: fan_controller
            code: !lambda return x.code;
            protocol: !lambda return x.protocol;
         
swing_fans:
  id: fan_controller
  remote_transmitter_id: transmitter # Use the transmitter ID above
  fans:
    # ... fan list ...
  on_transmit_begin:
    - cc1101.begin_tx: transceiver # Use the ID of the cc1101 component
  on_transmit_end:
    - cc1101.end_tx: transceiver   # Use the ID of the cc1101 component

fan: []
button: []
```

## Protocol Details

This component implements a specific protocol observed for certain ceiling fans:

* **Transmission:** Uses raw pulse width modulation.
    * Sync Pulse: `(-8900, 336)` microseconds
    * '0' Bit Pulse: `(-658, 336)` microseconds
    * '1' Bit Pulse: `(-321, 689)` microseconds
* **Data Structure:**
    * `[5-bit Fan ID][7-bit Command]` (12 bits total)
    * `[5-bit Fan ID][19-bit Command]` (24 bits total)
    * Both the ID and Command parts seem to be bitwise inverted in the raw transmission compared to logical representation. The component handles this inversion.
* **Reception:** Uses `remote_receiver` listening for `rc_switch` data, specifically checking for `protocol: 6`, which is close enough to the Swing Fans RF protocol for decoding (not for transmitting). It decodes the received `code` back into Fan ID and Command.
